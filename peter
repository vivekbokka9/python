with conn.cursor() as cur:
  alter_role = "ALTER USER \"%s\"" % pending_dict['username']
  cur.execute(alter_role + " WITH PASSWORD %s", (pending_dict['password'],))
  conn.commit()
we need to modify these lines

but before that we need to get current date and add 60 days
get this string like '2020-06-24' format
and then

alter_role = = "ALTER USER \"%s\"" % pending_dict['username']
alter_role=alter_role+ " WITH PASSWORD %s", (pending_dict['password']


alter_role=alter_role+ " VALID UNTIL '2020-06-24' "
cur.execute(alter_role )

the challenge is that date string has to be in 'xxxx-xx-xx' format, it can not be done dynamically
I believe that is the challenge and why AWS does not implment
